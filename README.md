UWP â†” STM32F401RE USB Communication using JSON ðŸ”„ðŸ’¡


This project demonstrates real-time serial communication over USB between a UWP (Universal Windows Platform) application and an STM32 Nucleo F401RE microcontroller. The system uses JSON-formatted messages to toggle an onboard LED on/off and to display dynamic sensor or simulated data on the UWP interface.

Key Features:

ðŸ”Œ USB Serial Communication using BufferedSerial (STM32) and LeanComms.cs (UWP).

ðŸ§  JSON Messaging Protocol for clear, structured two-way communication.

ðŸ’¡ LED Control from UWP to STM32 based on user commands.

ðŸ“Š Live Data Display on the UWP app to reflect dynamic updates from the STM32 board.

ðŸ§ª Educational Tool to observe and understand JSON message flow across MCU â†” UWP layers.

This setup is ideal for learning embeddedâ€“desktop communication, message structuring, and real-time system interaction.
